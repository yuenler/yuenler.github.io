          description="Developed educational technology apps as an EdTech Software Engineering Intern"
          longDescription="As an EdTech software engineering intern, I wrote TypeScript code that integrated
          with Canvas API to allow professors to easily migrate courses between semesters.
          I developed UI in React, allowing teachers to select which course and which items from that course they
          want to migrate.
          I conducted thorough unit testing with React Testing Library to ensure front-end components work correctly"

          description="Built a mobile app for Android and iOS (using React Native) that allows college students to share and
          find events on campus."
          longDescription="I built a mobile app for Android and iOS (using React Native) that allows college
          students to share and find events on campus.
          I integrated with Google Maps and Apple Maps API to create an interactive map showing all events
          happening.
          I wrote efficient memory-saving code that allows users to search, filter, star, and archive through
          hundreds of different events.
          The app authenticated users using their Google account and securely stored user data in Google Cloudâ€™s
          Firebase.
          I incorporated push notifications into the app so users are notified when events are happening near them.
          I published the app on the Apple App Store and Google Play and marketed the app on my college campus."

          longDescription="In my role, I used natural language processing (with NLTK) on journal entries
          submitted by users to provide journal sentiment insights.
          I integrated with Python Twilio API to create a fluid and natural texting experience for the user to
          submit journal entries.
          I developed UI such as a weekly summary, badges earned modal, and a heatmap of their mood over time.
          I created a Django MySQL database to store user profile information and user journal entries."
